This web-based terminal emulator provides a user-friendly interface for executing commands via a web browser. With its simple yet secure password protection mechanism, users can access the terminal remotely and execute commands seamlessly. Whether you're managing a server, performing administrative tasks, or simply exploring command-line operations, this tool offers a convenient solution accessible from anywhere with internet connectivity.

# Features: 

\- **Password Protection:** Ensure security with a password prompt, safeguarding access to the terminal.  
\- **Command Execution:** Execute commands directly within the web interface, with support for both Windows and Unix-based systems.  
\- **User-Friendly Interface:** Enjoy a clean and intuitive terminal interface, complete with input and output sections for seamless interaction.  
\- **Styling:** Enhance readability and aesthetics with a sleek, dark-themed design.  

# To set your own password:

\- **1.** Choose a password.  
\- **2.** Convert it to an MD5 hash using an online MD5 hash generator or a programming language.  
\- **3.** Replace the existing MD5 hash in the PHP code with your generated hash.  

The default password provided in the code is "123", with its MD5 hash being "202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70". However, it's safer to use a unique, strong password of your own.
